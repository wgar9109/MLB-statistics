    <h2 class="wrapper">In an essay published in the '84 Abstract,
        James explained his frustration about his refusal to the MLB's
        refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game.</h2>


    <h3 class="methods">Methods of madness!</h3>
    <p class="container">The Baseball Book (90-92) was a loosely organized collection of commentary,
        profiles,
        historical articles,
        and occasional pieces of research. James's assistant Rob Neyer was responsible for
        much of the research,
        and wrote several pamphlets.</p>

        <p class="container">Applied to an entire team or league,
            the statistic correlates closely (usually within 5%) to that team's
            or league's actual runs scored. Since James first created the statistic, sabermetricians have refined it to
            make it more accurate,
            and it is now used in many different variations</p>
